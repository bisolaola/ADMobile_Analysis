This analysis is for a fictional mobile phone provider called AD Mobile. AD Mobile wants to analyse its customer database with the objective to improve customer loyalty. 
It provide a 5% random sample of the customer activities for the last 3 months in two relational datasets, customer data and satisfaction score data. Using these datasets,
this analysis focused on answering the business question 'how loyal are the customers of AD Mobile?' and the 'contract terminated' variable as the key performance indicator (KPI). 
To conduct this analysis, the following was conducted: 
1. Data assessment to identify outliners and missing values
2. Data cleaning to the remove outliners and missing values 
3. Data modification and restrictions
4. Analysis
5. Visualization of insight in a dashboard 

The result revealed that AD Mobile retained 93% of its customers over the three months period.
It also signified that a high satisfaction score influences the rate customers terminate contracts. The higher the satisfaction score, the less likely customers of the company terminate their contracts.
Lastly, pay-as-you-go consumers have the highest tendency of terminating compared to consumers with other contract types.
